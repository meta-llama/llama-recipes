    "In this notebook we've explored two techniques for writing and executing SQL with LLMs using Groq API: Text-to-SQL (where the LLM generates SQL in the moment) and Verified Queries (where the LLM determines which verified query is most appropriate for your question and executes it). But perhaps the best approach is a blend - for ad-hoc reporting, there is still a lot of power in Text-to-SQL for quick answers. For user questions where there is no good verified query, you could default to using Text-To-SQL and then add that query to your dictionary of verified queries if it looks good. Either way, using LLMs on top of your data will lead to better and faster insights - just be sure to follow good data governance practices."
