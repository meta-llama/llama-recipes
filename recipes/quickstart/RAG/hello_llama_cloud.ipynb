    "* How to use LangChain to ask Llama general questions and follow up questions\n",
    "* How to use LangChain to load a recent web page - Hugging Face's [blog post on Llama 3.1](https://huggingface.co/blog/llama31) - and chat about it. This is the well known RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) method to let LLM such as Llama 3 be able to answer questions about the data not publicly available when Llama 3 was trained, or about your own data. RAG is one way to prevent LLM's hallucination\n",

    "**Note** We will be using [Replicate](https://replicate.com/meta/meta-llama-3.1-405b-instruct) to run the examples here. You will need to first sign in with Replicate with your github account, then create a free API token [here](https://replicate.com/account/api-tokens) that you can use for a while. You can also use other Llama 3.1 cloud providers such as [Groq](https://console.groq.com/), [Together](https://api.together.xyz/playground/language/meta-llama/Llama-3-8b-hf), or [Anyscale](https://app.endpoints.anyscale.com/playground) - see Section 2 of the Getting to Know Llama [notebook](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-recipes/blob/main/recipes/quickstart/Getting_to_know_Llama.ipynb) for more information."
