    "# Tool Calling 201: Llama to find Differences between two papers\n",
    "\n",
    "The image below illustrates the demo in this notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Use `Meta-Llama-3.1-70b` model to find the differences between two papers\n",
    "\n",
    "- Step 1: Take the user input query \n",
    "\n",
    "- Step 2: Perform an internet search using `tavily` API to fetch the arxiv ID(s) based on the user query\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: `3.1` models support `brave_search` but this notebook is also aimed at showcasing custom tools. \n",
    "\n",
    "The above is important because many-times the user-query is different from the paper name and arxiv ID-this will help us with the next step\n",
    "\n",
    "- Step 3: Use the web results to extract the arxiv ID(s) of the papers\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use an 8b model here because who wants to deal with complex regex, that's the main-use case of LLM(s), isn't it? :D\n",
    "\n",
    "- Step 4: Use `arxiv` API to download the PDF(s) of the papers in user query\n",
    "\n",
    "- Step 5: For ease, we will extract first 80k words from the PDF and write these to a `.txt` file that we can summarise\n",
    "\n",
    "- Step 6: Use instances of `Meta-Llama-3.1-8b` instances to summaries the two PDF(s)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Step 7: Prompt the `70b` model to get the differences between the two papers being discussed"

In particular, they were shown to rely on shallow heuristics in natural language inference (McCoy et al., 2019b; Zellers et al., 2019; Jin et al., 2020), reading comprehension (Si et al., 2019; Rogers et al., 2020; Sugawara et al., 2020; Yogatama et al., 2019), argument reasoning comprehension (Niven and Kao, 2019), and text classification (Jin et al., 2020). Several studies explored the possibilities of improving the fine-tuning of BERT:\\\\nTaking more layers into account: learning a complementary representation of the information in deep and output layers (Yang and Zhao, 2019), using a weighted combination of all layers instead of the final one (Su and Cheng, 2019; Kondratyuk and Straka, 2019), and layer dropout (Kondratyuk and Straka, 2019).\\\\n For BERT, Clark et al. (2019) observe that most heads in the same layer show similar self-attention patterns (perhaps related to the fact that the output of all self-attention heads in a layer is passed through the same MLP), which explains why Michel et al. (2019) were able to reduce most layers to a single head.\\\\n', 'score': 0.4248892, 'raw_content': None}], 'response_time': 2.16}\"}</function>\n"

      "This paper introduces Llama 3, a new set of foundation models developed by Meta AI. The Llama 3 family consists of models with 8B, 70B, and 405B parameters, capable of handling tasks in multiple languages and modalities. The paper details the pre-training and post-training processes, infrastructure improvements, and evaluations across various benchmarks. Llama 3 demonstrates competitive performance compared to other leading language models, including GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, on a wide range of tasks. The paper also explores multimodal capabilities by integrating vision and speech components, although these are still under development and not ready for release.\n",

      "Llama 3 includes models with 8B, 70B, and 405B parameters, with the flagship 405B model trained on 15.6T tokens.\n",
      "The models excel in multilingual capabilities, coding, reasoning, and tool usage.\n",
      "Llama 3 uses a dense Transformer architecture with minimal modifications, focusing on high-quality data and increased training scale.\n",
      "The training process involved significant infrastructure improvements to handle large-scale distributed training.\n",
      "Post-training includes supervised fine-tuning, rejection sampling, and direct preference optimization to align the model with human preferences.\n",
      "Llama 3 demonstrates competitive performance on various benchmarks, including MMLU, coding tasks, and math reasoning.\n",
      "The paper presents experiments on integrating vision and speech capabilities using a compositional approach.\n",

      "BERT is a novel language representation model developed by researchers at Google AI. It stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers and introduces a new approach to pre-training deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text. Unlike previous models that looked at text sequences either from left-to-right or combined left-to-right and right-to-left training, BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers.\n",
      "The key innovation is the application of bidirectional training of Transformer, a popular attention model, to language modeling. This is achieved through two pre-training tasks: Masked Language Model (MLM) and Next Sentence Prediction (NSP). In MLM, the model attempts to predict masked words in a sentence, allowing it to incorporate context from both directions. NSP trains the model to understand relationships between sentences.\n",
      "BERT significantly outperformed previous state-of-the-art models on a wide range of NLP tasks, including question answering, natural language inference, and others, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. The researchers demonstrated the effectiveness of BERT by obtaining new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks.\n",
      "Key Takeaways:\n",
      "\n",
      "BERT introduces deep bidirectional representations, overcoming limitations of previous unidirectional or shallowly bidirectional models.\n",
      "The model uses \"masked language modeling\" (MLM) for bidirectional training of Transformer.\n",
      "BERT is pre-trained on two tasks: masked language modeling and next sentence prediction.\n",
      "It achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 NLP tasks, including an improvement of 7.7% on the GLUE benchmark.\n",
      "BERT's architecture allows for fine-tuning with just one additional output layer, making it versatile for various NLP tasks.\n",
      "The model demonstrates that deep bidirectional language representation improves language understanding compared to left-to-right or shallow bidirectional approaches.\n",
      "BERT's performance improves with larger model sizes, even on small-scale tasks.\n",
      "The pre-training of BERT is computationally expensive but fine-tuning is relatively inexpensive.\n",
      "BERT can be used for both fine-tuning and as a feature-based approach, with competitive results in both scenarios.\n",

In particular, they were shown to rely on shallow heuristics in natural language inference (McCoy et al., 2019b; Zellers et al., 2019; Jin et al., 2020), reading comprehension (Si et al., 2019; Rogers et al., 2020; Sugawara et al., 2020; Yogatama et al., 2019), argument reasoning comprehension (Niven and Kao, 2019), and text classification (Jin et al., 2020). Several studies explored the possibilities of improving the fine-tuning of BERT:\\nTaking more layers into account: learning a complementary representation of the information in deep and output layers (Yang and Zhao, 2019), using a weighted combination of all layers instead of the final one (Su and Cheng, 2019; Kondratyuk and Straka, 2019), and layer dropout (Kondratyuk and Straka, 2019).\\n For BERT, Clark et al. (2019) observe that most heads in the same layer show similar self-attention patterns (perhaps related to the fact that the output of all self-attention heads in a layer is passed through the same MLP), which explains why Michel et al. (2019) were able to reduce most layers to a single head.\\n', 'score': 0.4250085, 'raw_content': None}], 'response_time': 2.2}]\n",
