# Llama Cookbook: The Official Guide to building with Llama Models

Welcome to the official repository for helping you get started with [inference](./getting-started/inference/), [fine-tuning](./getting-started/finetuning) and [end-to-end use-cases](./end-to-end-use-cases) of building with the Llama Model family.

This repository covers the most popular community approaches, use-cases and the latest recipes for Llama Text and Vision models.

## Repository Structure:

- [3P Integrations](./3p-integrations): Getting Started Recipes and End to End Use-Cases from various Llama providers
- [End to End Use Cases](./end-to-end-use-cases): As the name suggests, spanning various domains and applications
- [Getting Started](./getting-started/): Reference for inferencing, fine-tuning and RAG examples
- [src](./src/): Contains the src for the original llama-recipes library along with some FAQs for fine-tuning.

## FAQ:

- Q: What happened to llama-recipes?

A: We recently renamed llama-recipes to llama-cookbook

- Q: Prompt Template changes for Multi-Modality?

A: Llama 3.2 follows the same prompt template as Llama 3.1, with a new special token `<|image|>` representing the input image for the multimodal models.

More details on the prompt templates for image reasoning, tool-calling and code interpreter can be found [on the documentation website](https://llama.meta.com/docs/model-cards-and-prompt-formats/llama3_2).

- Q: I have some questions for Fine-Tuning, is there a section to address these?

A: Checkout the Fine-Tuning FAQ [here](./src/docs/)

- Q: Some links are broken/folders are missing:

A: We recently did a refactor of the repo, [archive-main](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-cookbook/tree/archive-main) is a snapshot branch from before the refactor

- Where can we find details about the latest models?

A: Official [Llama models website](https://www.llama.com)
